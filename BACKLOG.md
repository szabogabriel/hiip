## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Notes

### Getting Started
1. Begin with Priority 1 items as they are essential for a production-ready application
2. Focus on testing infrastructure early to ensure quality
3. Implement security features before deploying to production
4. Database migration should be planned carefully

### Technical Considerations
- Maintain backward compatibility when implementing API changes
- Consider performance impact of new features
- Ensure proper error handling and logging for all new features
- Document all configuration changes and new environment variables

### Dependencies to Add
- Spring Boot Starter Test
- Spring Security Test
- Flyway or Liquibase for database migrations
- Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring
- Swagger/OpenAPI for documentation
- Redis for caching (when implementing caching features)

### Estimated Effort
- **Priority 1**: 3-4 weeks (essential features)
- **Priority 2**: 2-3 weeks (user experience improvements)
- **Priority 3**: 3-4 weeks (enhanced functionality)
- **Priority 4**: 4-6 weeks (nice to have features)

*Note: Effort estimates are approximate and may vary based on team size and experience.*
