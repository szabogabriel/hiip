# Token Revocation (Logout) Implementation

## Overview

This application now implements **proper JWT token revocation** when users log out. Previously, the logout was client-side only, meaning that tokens remained valid even after logout. Now, when a user logs out, their token is added to a **blacklist** and becomes immediately invalid.

## How It Works

### 1. Token Blacklist Database
When a user logs out:
- The JWT token is extracted from the request
- The token is stored in the `revoked_tokens` database table
- The token's expiration date is also stored

### 2. Token Validation Check
On every API request:
- The JWT filter checks if the token is in the blacklist
- If the token is revoked, the request is rejected (401 Unauthorized)
- If the token is valid and not revoked, the request proceeds normally

### 3. Automatic Cleanup
To prevent the database from growing indefinitely:
- A scheduled task runs daily at 3 AM
- It removes all expired tokens from the blacklist
- This keeps the database size manageable

## Components

### New Entity: `RevokedToken`
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "revoked_tokens")
public class RevokedToken {
    private Long id;
    private String token;
    private String username;
    private LocalDateTime revokedAt;
    private LocalDateTime expirationDate;
}
```

### New Repository: `RevokedTokenRepository`
Provides methods to:
- Check if a token exists in the blacklist
- Add tokens to the blacklist
- Clean up expired tokens

### New Service: `TokenRevocationService`
Handles:
- Token revocation (adding to blacklist)
- Token validation (checking blacklist)
- Scheduled cleanup of expired tokens

### Updated Components:
1. **JwtAuthenticationFilter** - Now checks blacklist before authenticating
2. **AuthFacadeService.logoutUser()** - Now revokes the token server-side
3. **AuthController.logoutUser()** - Now accepts HttpServletRequest to extract token
4. **DataStorageApplication** - Added `@EnableScheduling` for cleanup task

## Testing the Feature

### Test Case 1: Normal Logout
```bash
# 1. Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'

# Response: {"token":"eyJhbGc...", "refreshToken":"..."}

# 2. Use the token to access data (should work)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/data \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGc..."

# Response: 200 OK with data

# 3. Logout
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/logout \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGc..."

# Response: "User logged out successfully. Token has been revoked."

# 4. Try to use the same token again (should fail)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/data \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGc..."

# Response: 401 Unauthorized (token is revoked)
```

### Test Case 2: Verify Database
```sql
-- Check revoked tokens
SELECT * FROM revoked_tokens;

-- You should see entries like:
-- id | token                  | username | revoked_at          | expiration_date
-- 1  | eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI... | admin    | 2025-10-25 11:00:00 | 2025-10-25 12:00:00
```

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required. The feature uses the existing JWT expiration settings:

```properties
# application.properties
hiip.jwt.expiration=3600000  # 1 hour in milliseconds
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes
The `revoked_tokens` table has indexes on:
- `token` - for fast lookup during authentication
- `expirationDate` - for efficient cleanup queries

### Cleanup Schedule
The cleanup task runs daily at 3 AM:
```java
@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 3 * * *")
```

You can customize this by modifying `TokenRevocationService.cleanupExpiredTokens()`

### Token Size
- Tokens are stored with a maximum length of 500 characters
- This is sufficient for standard JWTs
- If you use larger tokens, adjust the column size in `RevokedToken` entity

## Migration Notes

### Database Schema
The new `revoked_tokens` table will be automatically created by Hibernate when you restart the application (if using `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update` or `create`).

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing tokens issued before this update will continue to work
- They can still be revoked upon logout
- No changes needed to client applications

## Security Benefits

✅ **Immediate Token Invalidation** - Tokens are invalid immediately after logout  
✅ **Session Termination** - Users are truly logged out  
✅ **Security Incident Response** - Can revoke tokens if credentials are compromised  
✅ **Compliance** - Meets security requirements for proper logout  
✅ **Audit Trail** - Track when tokens were revoked  

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
1. **Revoke All User Tokens** - Add endpoint to revoke all tokens for a specific user
2. **Token Refresh Blacklist** - Also blacklist refresh tokens
3. **Redis Caching** - Use Redis instead of database for faster lookups
4. **Admin Dashboard** - View and manually revoke active tokens
5. **Configurable Cleanup** - Make cleanup schedule configurable via properties

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Token still works after logout
**Cause**: The application might not have been restarted with the new code  
**Solution**: Restart the application

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized immediately after login
**Cause**: Clock skew or token generation issue  
**Solution**: Check system time, verify JWT secret is set correctly

### Issue: Database growing too large
**Cause**: Cleanup task not running  
**Solution**: 
- Verify `@EnableScheduling` is present on main application class
- Check application logs for cleanup messages
- Manually run cleanup: Call `TokenRevocationService.cleanupExpiredTokens()`

### Issue: Performance degradation
**Cause**: Too many records in revoked_tokens table  
**Solution**:
- Verify cleanup task is running
- Consider shorter JWT expiration times
- Consider using Redis for token blacklist instead of database

## API Changes

### Logout Endpoint
```
POST /api/v1/auth/logout
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Response: 200 OK
"User logged out successfully. Token has been revoked."
```

The logout endpoint now:
- Requires the token in the Authorization header
- Returns an error if no token is provided
- Actually revokes the token server-side

## Conclusion

Your application now has proper JWT token revocation! When users log out, their tokens are immediately invalidated and cannot be used for subsequent requests. This provides better security and meets best practices for authentication systems.
