# Hybrid Category Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The hybrid category system with user ownership and sharing capabilities has been successfully implemented.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Category Ownership** (`createdBy` field)
- Categories track their creator
- Automatically set when creating data with categories
- Enables permission-based access control

### 2. **Global Categories** (`isGlobal` flag)
- Admin-created categories accessible to all users
- Cannot be modified by regular users
- Useful for system-wide standards

### 3. **Category Sharing** (NEW Entity: `CategoryShare`)
- Share categories with specific users
- Granular permissions: `canRead` and `canWrite`
- Many-to-many relationship with permission flags
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate shares

### 4. **Permission System**
- **Read Permission**: View category and its data
- **Write Permission**: Create/update data in category
- **Owner**: Full control including sharing
- **Global**: Read-only for all users

## Files Created (3 new)

1. **`CategoryShare.java`** - Entity for sharing relationships
   - Maps category to users with permissions
   - Tracks when shared and last updated
   - Unique constraint on (category, username)

2. **`CategoryShareRepository.java`** - Data access for shares
   - Find shares by category
   - Find shares by user
   - Check existence and permissions
   - Delete shares

3. **`CategoryShareRequest.java`** - DTO for sharing requests
   - Username to share with
   - Read/write permission flags

4. **`CategoryShareResponse.java`** - DTO for sharing responses
   - Share details with timestamps
   - Permission information

5. **`CATEGORY-SHARING-FEATURE.md`** - Complete documentation

## Files Modified (6)

1. **`Category.java`** - Added ownership and sharing
   - `createdBy` field
   - `isGlobal` flag
   - `sharedWith` relationship (OneToMany to CategoryShare)
   - Helper methods: `isAccessibleBy()`, `hasWritePermission()`, `shareWith()`, `unshareWith()`

2. **`CategoryRepository.java`** - Added user-specific queries
   - `findAccessibleByUser()` - Categories user can see
   - `findWritableByUser()` - Categories user can modify
   - `findByCreatedByOrderByPath()` - User's own categories
   - `findByIsGlobalTrueOrderByPath()` - Global categories

3. **`CategoryService.java`** - Added sharing methods

   - `getCategoriesWritableByUser()`
   - `shareCategory()`
   - `unshareCategory()`
   - `getCategoryShares()`

4. **`CategoryController.java`** - Added sharing endpoints
   - `POST /{id}/share` - Share category with user
   - `DELETE /{id}/share/{username}` - Unshare category
   - `GET /{id}/shares` - Get all shares for category
   - `GET /my-categories` - Get user's accessible categories
   - Updated response DTOs to include ownership and shares

5. **`CategoryResponse.java`** - Added new fields
   - `createdBy` - Category creator
   - `isGlobal` - Global flag
   - `sharedWith` - List of shares

6. **`DataStorageFacadeService.java`** - Pass username to category service
   - Updated `createData()` to pass owner username
   - Updated `updateData()` to pass owner username

## Database Schema Changes

### Updated Table: `categories`
```sql
ALTER TABLE categories ADD COLUMN created_by VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE categories ADD COLUMN is_global BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

### New Table: `category_shares`
```sql
CREATE TABLE category_shares (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    category_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES categories(id),
    shared_with_username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    can_read BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
    can_write BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    shared_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE (category_id, shared_with_username)
);
```

## API Endpoints

### Category Sharing (NEW)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/v1/categories/{id}/share` | Share category with user |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/categories/{id}/share/{username}` | Unshare category |
| GET | `/api/v1/categories/{id}/shares` | Get all shares |
| GET | `/api/v1/categories/my-categories` | Get accessible categories |

### Existing Endpoints (Enhanced)
- All category endpoints now respect user permissions
- Responses include `createdBy`, `isGlobal`, and `sharedWith` fields

## Key Features

### ✅ Privacy by Default
- Categories created by users are private
- Only creator and explicitly shared users can access

### ✅ Selective Sharing
- Share categories with specific users
- Granular read/write permissions
- Update permissions anytime

### ✅ Collaboration
- Read-only sharing for viewing
- Read-write sharing for collaboration
- Owner retains full control

### ✅ Global Categories
- System-wide categories for standards
- Admin-only modification
- All users can read and use

### ✅ Permission Enforcement
- All operations check permissions
- 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access
- Ownership verification on sharing

## Access Control

### Category Visibility
User can see a category if:
1. Category is global, OR
2. User created the category, OR
3. Category is shared with user (canRead=true)

### Write Permission
User can modify a category if:
1. User created the category, OR
2. Category is shared with user (canWrite=true)

**Note:** Global categories cannot be modified by regular users

## Usage Examples

### Create Private Category
```bash
# User creates data → category created with ownership
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/data \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"content": {...}, "category": "my/private/category"}'
```

### Share Category (Read-Only)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/categories/1/share \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"username": "colleague", "canRead": true, "canWrite": false}'
```

### Share Category (Read-Write)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/categories/1/share \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"username": "teammate", "canRead": true, "canWrite": true}'
```

### View Accessible Categories
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/categories/my-categories \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Unshare Category
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/v1/categories/1/share/colleague \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Build Status

✅ **BUILD SUCCESS** - 51 source files compiled (up from 47)
- All new entities compile correctly

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully Backward Compatible**
- Existing categories work as before

- `isGlobal` defaults to false
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Existing data unaffected

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Ownership Tracking
- Know who created each category
- Audit trail for category lifecycle
- Enables permission-based access

### 2. Permission Verification
- All sharing operations verify ownership
- HTTP 403 for unauthorized actions
- Prevents unauthorized category access

### 3. Granular Permissions
- Separate read and write permissions
- Fine-grained access control
- Flexible collaboration models

### 4. Global Category Protection
- Admin-only modification
- Prevents accidental system changes
- Maintains data integrity

## Testing Checklist

## Summary

The hybrid category model successfully combines:
- **User ownership** for privacy
- **Sharing capabilities** for collaboration  
- **Global categories** for standards
- **Permission system** for security

This provides a robust, flexible, and secure foundation for multi-user category management with fine-grained access control.

## Next Steps

Application is ready for testing. To verify the implementation:

1. **Start the application**: `mvn spring-boot:run`
2. **Test via Swagger**: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
3. **Test sharing flow**:
   - User A creates data with category
   - User A shares category with User B
   - User B can now access the category
   - User A can revoke access

See **CATEGORY-SHARING-FEATURE.md** for detailed testing procedures and examples.
